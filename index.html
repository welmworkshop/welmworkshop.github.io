Language models that have been trained on unlabeled text data are a cornerstone of modern natural language processing (NLP) research, and many recent state-of-the-art results in NLP were achieved by leveraging these self-supervised models.
The success of this recipe is largely thanks to scalability: Better results can often be obtained by training larger models on larger amounts of unlabeled text data.
This synergy is particularly fruitful thanks to the wide availability of unlabeled text data on the internet and the continual improvement of hardware accelerators for training machine learning models.
Notable examples of models that make use of this scalability include [RoBERTa](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11692), which attained dramatically better performance simply by training for longer; [T5-11B](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10683), which achieved near-human performance on the challenging SuperGLUE benchmark by scaling to 11 billion parameters; [GShard](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.16668), which produced a 600-billion parameter machine translation model that supports over 100 languages with state-of-the-art accuracy; and [GPT-3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165), which showed that scaling language models beyond 100 billion parameters could achieve strong performance on many tasks without any further task-specific training.
Indeed, the "[scaling laws](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08361)" of these models demonstrate approximately log-linear improvements in performance over more than 6 orders of magnitude in parameter count.
Naïve extrapolation of these trends suggests that a model with an additional 3-5 orders of magnitude of parameters would saturate performance on most current benchmarks.

These results place our field at a crossroads.
Will scaling lead to models that outperform humans on all text-based tasks, or are there limits to the scalability of these models?
Should we focus on simply scaling these models, or should we design more sophisticated architectures and training schemes?
Are there fundamental capabilities humans have but large language models lack, and do our current benchmarks test these capabilities?
Does training on unstructured text from the web cause these models to inherit bias or memorize sensitive information?
Is using this data legal or ethical?
What can we learn from the fields of cognition, linguistics, and philosophy as we attempt to measure the “intelligence” of machines?
The goal of this workshop is to find answers to these questions by inviting a diverse group of researchers to critically examine the state of giant language models.
We also hope to provide concrete evidence of the capabilities and limitations of current enormous language models through a participant-driven benchmark.

This workshop will have a non-standard submission format: Rather than submitting research papers, participants will be invited to contribute diverse tasks that they believe measure uniquely human or particularly challenging capabilities for large language models.
Teams at Google and OpenAI have committed to evaluate this task set on their best-performing model architectures, across models spanning from tens of thousands through hundreds of billions or more of parameters.
Researchers will also be invited to contribute and evaluate their own models on these tasks.
We will analyze these experiments, and report the results at the workshop, with a particular focus on how model performance on different task types scales with model size.
By inviting contributions of tasks or models, we provide a means for researchers to participate whether or not they have the (cost-prohibitive) computational resources to train giant language models.
The end result will be the *Beyond the Imitation Game Benchmark (BIG Bench)*: A novel participant-driven test of the limits of giant language models.
